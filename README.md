Accident detection in video surveillance systems is essential for ensuring a rapid response and minimizing potential harm in various environments, such as traffic intersections, highways, and public spaces. Prompt identification of accidents can significantly enhance the effectiveness of emergency response teams, reduce the severity of injuries, and potentially save lives. This study aims to develop a robust accident detection system using advanced machine learning techniques, integrating a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) for video classification with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for temporal anomaly detection and Isolation Forest for spatial anomaly detection.# Automatic-Accident-detection-using-3DCNN-Model

**The implementation of the accident detection system involves several key steps:**

**Data Collection and Preprocessing****:** The CCD dataset is divided into training and validation sets. Each video is split into frames, and the frames are resized to a consistent dimension to ensure uniform input for the 3D CNN. Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, and scaling, are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and enhance the model's robustness.

*Model Training:*The 3D CNN is trained using the preprocessed frames, with a categorical cross-entropy loss function and an Adam optimizer. The network learns to differentiate between accident and non-accident frames by minimizing the loss function. Once the 3D CNN is trained, the spatiotemporal features extracted from the CNN are fed into the LSTM network. The LSTM is trained to identify temporal anomalies using a similar optimization approach.

**Anomaly Detection:** The Isolation Forest is trained using the spatial features extracted from the video frames. This unsupervised learning approach does not require labeled data, making it well-suited for detecting anomalies in diverse scenarios.

**System Integration: **The trained models (3D CNN, LSTM, and Isolation Forest) are integrated into a unified system. The video feed from the surveillance cameras is processed in real-time, with frames analyzed sequentially by the 3D CNN, LSTM, and Isolation Forest. The system outputs an alert when an accident is detected, providing a timestamp and location for immediate response.
